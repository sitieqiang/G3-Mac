# 7.10.6 Annex : MAC acknowledgement MAC确认
　　The present specification does not use IEEE802.15.4-2006 MAC acknowledgment frame but specifies a positive and negative acknowledgments using Frame Control Header (section 5.5 of PHY specification).  
　　本说明书不使用IEEE802.15.4-2006 MAC确认帧，而是使用帧控制报头（PHY规范的第5.5节）指定肯定和否定确认。  

　　The Frame Control Header contains an information used by all stations in the network for channel access, as well as PHY receiver information used by the destination. For this reason, Frame Control Header has specific physical layer encoding and modulation as defined in PHY specification.  
　　帧控制报头包含网络中所有站用于信道访问的信息，以及目的地使用的PHY接收机信息。因此，帧控制报头具有PHY规范中定义的特定物理层编码和调制。  

　　Only Frame Control Header will be used as positive (ACK) or negative (NACK) acknowledgement.  
　　只有帧控制报头将用作肯定（ACK）或否定（NACK）确认。  

　　The packet originator may request an acknowledgment by setting Delimiter Type field of Frame Control Header (section 5.5 of PHY specification).  
　　分组发起方可以通过设置帧控制报头的分隔符类型字段（PHY规范的第5.5节）来请求确认。  

　　The receiver will send ACK to the originator if it is requested and the MAC frame was decoded correctly by PHY.  
　　如果请求并且MAC帧由PHY正确解码，则接收器将向始发者发送ACK。  

　　The receiver will send NACK to the originator if it is requested and the received MAC frame is corrupted and cannot be recovered by PHY.  
　　如果接收机被请求并且接收到的MAC帧被破坏并且不能被PHY恢复，则接收机将向始发者发送NACK。  

　　ACK and NACK frames contain the 16-bit CRC (MAC FCS field) received in the MAC frame for which the ACK or NACK response is being sent. These 16 bits are used as ACK or NACK identifier and located in 2 bytes of FCH (TM[0:7] and PDC) (see 5.5 of PHY specification). The transmitter will compare against transmitted FCS to determine  validity of the response. If it matches of transmitted FCS, the response is accepted. If it does not match the FCS, the response is ignored and treated as a collision.  
　　ACK和NACK帧包含在正在发送ACK或NACK响应的MAC帧中接收的16位CRC（MAC FCS字段）。这16位用作ACK或NACK标识符并位于FCH（TM [0：7]和PDC）的2字节中（见PHY规范的5.5）。发射机将与传输的FCS进行比较以确定响应的有效性。如果它与传输的FCS匹配，则接受响应。如果它与FCS不匹配，则响应将被忽略并被视为冲突。
