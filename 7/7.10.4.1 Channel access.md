# 7.10.4.1 Channel access 频道访问
　　The channel access is accomplished by using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism with a random backoff time. The random backoff mechanism spreads the time over which stations attempt to transmit, thereby reducing the probability of collision. Each time a device wishes to transmit data frames, it shall wait for a random period. If the channel is found to be idle, following the random backoff, the device shall transmit its data. If the channel is found to be busy, following the random backoff, the device shall wait for another random period before trying to access the channel again.  
　　通过使用具有随机退避时间的具有冲突避免的载波侦听多路访问（CSMA / CA）机制来实现信道访问。随机回退机制扩展了站试图发送的时间，从而降低了冲突的概率。每次设备希望发送数据帧时，它将等待随机时段。如果发现信道是空闲的，则在随机退避之后，设备将发送其数据。如果发现信道忙，在随机退避之后，设备将在尝试再次访问信道之前等待另一个随机周期。  

　　A Carrier sense is a fundamental part of the distributed access procedure. Physical Carrier Sense (PCS) is provided by the PHY upon detection of the Preamble. In the latter case, PCS shall stay high long enough to be detected and Virtual Carrier Sense (VCS) to be asserted by the MAC. A virtual carrier sense mechanism is provided by  the MAC by tracking the expected duration of channel occupancy. Virtual carrier sense is set by the length of received packet or upon collision. In these cases, virtual carrier sense tracks the expected duration of the Busy state of the medium. The medium shall also be considered Busy when the station is transmitting.  
　　载波侦听是分布式访问过程的基本部分。物理载波侦听（PCS）在检测到前导码时由PHY提供。在后一种情况下，PCS将保持高到足以被检测到并且MAC由MAC断言的虚拟载波侦听（VCS）。 MAC通过跟踪信道占用的预期持续时间来提供虚拟载波侦听机制。虚拟载波侦听由接收到的分组的长度或在冲突时设置。在这些情况下，虚拟载波侦听跟踪介质的忙状态的预期持续时间。当站正在发射时，介质也应被视为忙。

　　A VCS timer is maintained by all stations to improve reliability of channel access. The VCS timer is set based on received long (data) or short (ACK) frames. The VCS timer is also set upon collision or when the station powers up. Stations use this information to compute the expected Busy condition of the medium or the expected duration of the Contention State and store this information in the VCS timer.  
　　VCS计时器由所有站维护以提高信道访问的可靠性。基于接收到的长（数据）或短（ACK）帧来设置VCS定时器。 VCS计时器也在碰撞时或在站上电时设置。站使用此信息来计算介质的预期忙碌条件或竞争状态的预期持续时间，并将此信息存储在VCS定时器中。  

　　A Collision occurs in each of the following circumstances:  
　　在以下每种情况下都会发生冲突：
- The transmitting station receives a something other than ACK or NACK response when a response is expected.  
当期望响应时，发射站接收到除了ACK或NACK响应之外的事物。
- The transmitting station shall infer a Collision from the absence of any response to a transmission when a response is expected. Note that the absence of a response could also be the result of a bad channel. Since there is no way to distinguish between the two causes a Collision is inferred.  
当期望响应时，发射站将从没有对传输的任何响应推断出冲突。注意，没有响应也可能是坏信道的结果。由于没有办法区分两个原因，因此推断可能是碰撞。
