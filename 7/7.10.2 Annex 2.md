# 7.10.2 Annex 2:Routing Cost 路由花费

　　This part describes the characteristics a routing cost used in the LOAD routing algorithm (described in [draft-load] and clause 5.4 of the present document) must have.  
**此处的clause 5.4对应7.8.5**  
　　这部分描述了在LOAD路由算法（在本文件的[draft-load]和第5.4节中描述）中使用的路由成本  

　　A route cost is defined as the sum of all the link costs on the route. As described in[draft-load], a route cost is an integer value between 0 and 255, lower values meaning better routes. As there can be at most 8 hops on a route as defined in clause 5.2 of the present document (modified clause 5.2 from [rfc4944]), a link cost is an integer between 0 and 31.
　　路由的成本被定义为在该路由上所有连接的成本之和。如同[draft-load]中的描述，路由成本是一个0-255的整型值，低的数值代表好的路由。如同修订后的[rfc4944]最大允许8跳。由此一个连接的成本应该是0-31之间的一个整型值。

　　If we note *P* a route which goes through devices {D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>,..., D<sub>N-1</sub>}, where N is the
number of hops on the route (0 < N ≤ 8), and C{[D<sub>i</sub>, D<sub>j</sub>]} the link cost between devices D<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>j</sub> , the route cost RC(P) of P can then be defined as

$$RC(P) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \{[D_i,D_{i+1}]\}$$

　　The link cost should take into account PHY transmission parameters, number of hops, etc… Complete description of a link cost is out of the scope of this document.
　　连接的成本应该有物理层的传输参数，跳数等共同决定。连接成本的完整的描述不在本文档讨论范围内。
